# 🚇 Air Quality & Public Transport: A Two-Way Relationship  

This project explores the correlation between air quality and public transport usage in New York City. Our goal was to analyze whether bad air quality leads to increased or decreased public transport use and to identify potential trends in this relationship.  

## 📊 Data Sources  

- **NYC Metro Turnstile Data**: [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/turnstile-usage-data-2022)  
- **Air Quality Data**: [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution#history)  

## 📌 Key Findings  

1. **Initial Mistake**: Our early data mistakenly included Madrid instead of NYC, leading to misleading results.  
2. **Weather vs. Air Quality**: Air quality alone didn't significantly impact public transport use—seasonal changes did.  
3. **Refined Analysis**: When considering only warm months, we found that higher air pollution days correlated with reduced public transport use.  
4. **A Two-Way Relationship**: People were more likely to use public transport when pollution was lower, but pollution also increased when public transport use decreased (potentially due to higher car usage).
